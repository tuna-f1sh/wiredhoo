# WiredHoo

Project to add **wired** connectivity to a Wahoo Kick by emulating the ANT wireless protocol within an emulated ANT USB stick; the host believes it is communicating to an ANT+ wireless device.

Fed up with wireless connectivity issues, I decided to come up with a solution. The ergo trainer and inertial measurement stems from the work done by [Budget Trainer Build](https://budgettrainerbuild.wordpress.com/)

Broader scope for this project is to become an open-source firmware alternative for inertial trainers.

## TODO - See GitHub discussions

 - [x] Create ANT USB device.
- [x] Emulate ANT control.
- [x] Emulate ANT+ power meter and fitness control profiles.
- [ ] CI tests for the above.
- [ ] Light sensor speed reading: TIM counter input capture, Iâ€™ve got most of this just need to test.
- [ ] Moment of inertia based power measurement: based on work done by Budget trainer build
- [ ] Back EMF resistance control: PID controller based on measured power to setpoint error.
- [ ] Spin-down routine: linear lookup table.
- [ ] ADC sampling: vsense, emf sense - the ADC is initialised but thinking DMA circular buffer.
- [ ] LED routines ðŸ’„: basic but also thinking WS2812B for power level indication.

# Build

## Requirements

* `arm-none-eabi-gcc` (version 10 used) and a SWD flashing tool (Black Magic Probe, STLINK or similar) for development.
* `make upload` assumes a [Black Magic Probe](https://1bitsquared.com/products/black-magic-probe) is being used with [Tagconnect TC2030 CTX](https://www.tag-connect.com/product/tc2030-ctx-nl-6-pin-no-legs-cable-with-10-pin-micro-connector-for-cortex-processors).
* An STM32F4 dev board: I'm using the Feather STM32F4. Will probably make custom PCB at some point to replace Kickr board.
* _STM32CubeMX if changing chip setup_

```
make # compile with debug flags
make upload # upload to board via SWD
make attach # attach for GDB debug
```
