# WiredHoo

Project to add **wired** connectivity to a Wahoo Kick by emulating the ANT wireless protocol within an emulated ANT USB stick; the host believes it is communicating to an ANT+ wireless device.

Fed up with wireless connectivity issues, I decided to come up with a solution. The ergo trainer and inertial measurement stems from the work done by [Budget Trainer Build](https://budgettrainerbuild.wordpress.com/)

Broader scope for this project is to become an open-source firmware alternative for inertial trainers.

## TODO - See GitHub discussions

 - [x] Create ANT USB device.
 - [x] Emulate ANT control.
 - [x] Emulate ANT+ power meter and fitness control profiles.
 - [ ] Light sensor speed reading.
 - [ ] Moment of inertia based power measurement.
 - [ ] Back EMF resistance control.
 - [ ] Spin-down routine.
